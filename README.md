# My Father, The explainer

I’d like you to create a Wordpress site to feature My Father The Explainer, videos 
It should have a template that lends itself easily to the embedding of youtube videos and where I can easily add the script of my dad’s videos.  

It should have an about page that we will write the copy for in the future. It should have a backup, sitemap and SEO plugins built in like Yoast and Squirly. It should also include miscellaneous fixes, requests and updates in order to get the Wordpress site shippable. Also, the code should be cleanly separated from the install and in a github repository, including instructions on how to spin up the site and theme from that codebase.
